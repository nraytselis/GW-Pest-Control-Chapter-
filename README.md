The files in this directory are all related to a project aimed at understanding population rebound dynamics of Eucyclops sp. copepods in response to culling events designed to mimic Abate pesticide control. The project involved a mesocosm experiment with interventions applied every 28 days. The results of the experiment were integrated into a Bayesian MCMC state space modeling framework. The parameter estimates were then incorporated into mechansitic models with GW parasites to assess whether suppressing copepod population densities is an effective way of controlling GW disease.
